# Mini Project-2
## Data

In this mini-project  classification task on 
[CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset and reporting the f1-score as well as the accuracy on the test dataset is done. 
## Representation and Dimensionality Reduction

Taking three representations,

1. Raw Data 
2. PCA 
3. LDA  

## Classifiers

Taking classifiers,

1. CART/Decision Tree 
2. Soft-margin Linear SVM 
3. Kernel SVM with RBF Kernel 
4. MLP  

Used implementations from standard libraries.

## Experiments:

1. Split the training data into train, val (80:20). 
2. Show overfitting and discuss strategies that can minimize
   overfitting.
4. Report the accuracy and F1-score on test dataset.
3. Clearly show the analysis/experiments for the hyperparameter selection.
are done.
